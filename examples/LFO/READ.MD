LFO 
  This code by Andy Cobley
  Rate is controlled by CV1, Shape by CV2. The shape changes the duty cycle, for a Square wave this gives PWM, Triangle from +saw to triangle to -Saw. There others similarly.

Encoder position

1: Sine
2: Square
3: Triangle
4: Sine based on Triangle (can produce a nice output)

5,6,7,8 the same but slower cycles
9 Same as 4 but even slower.
