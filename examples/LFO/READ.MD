LFO 
This code by Andy Cobley
Rate is controlled by CV1, Shape by CV2. The shape changes the duty cycle, for a Square wave this gives PWM, Triangle from +saw to triangle to -Saw. There others similarly.

Encoder position

0: Sine
1: Square
2: Triangle
3: Sine based on Triangle (can produce a nice output)

4,5,6,7 the same but slower cycles
Higher encoder positons give slower cycles still .
Loops at 19 and 0
